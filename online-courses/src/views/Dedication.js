      <><h1 class="heading">Dedication of “Rules” to the first radical: Lucifer</h1>
            
      <p>Among the most infamous aspects of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals was its dedication to “the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom—Lucifer.” Likewise, as a reflection of the highest representation of wickedness, the goal of leftists is not to win fairly or honorably, but simply to win even if that means using lies and deception. This mindset manifests itself in the glaring arrogance and hypocrisy with which leftists shamelessly but relentlessly attempt to establish one set of rules for themselves, while dictating a wholly different and deliberately stringent set of standards by which to constrain their conservative opposition. Only in this manner can they expect to maintain their presumed dominance of the “moral high ground.”</p> 

      <p>Along with its stated purpose of remaking the world, Rules represents the ultimate testament to Alinsky’s belief in his undisputed superiority over modern society. Inspired followers and colleagues of Alinsky have gone on to develop even more devious tactics and plans to implement their revolutionary agenda. This arrogant mindset has been diligently instilled in both devoted liberal activists and any who fall, even temporarily, under their dominion, the largest such group being students in government schools. As a result, the once unrivaled U.S. education system now more closely resembles Maoist “retraining camps” than the former openness, inquisitiveness, innovation, and ingenuity of American academe. So effective has this approach proven to be for Leftists that during the past quarter century, despite which party officially holds majority status in Congress, the Democrat “vision” for America’s future advanced virtually unhindered. </p></>
