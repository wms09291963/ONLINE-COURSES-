      <p>Another day dawns, and with it comes another Leftist assault on America’s founding principles, which were established as a firewall against efforts to subvert and destroy our nation and our way of life. For several decades, the good people of America have watched their once-great country being dismantled before their eyes, as one institution after another is systematically targeted, attacked, and destroyed under a relentless onslaught from the leftist counterculture. In each ensuing episode, a flawed leftist opinion is suddenly elevated to center-stage and any opposition to it deemed first “controversial,” and soon thereafter, taboo. Eventually, all remaining vestiges of resistance to it crumble, leaving every Liberal notion, from the absurd to the abhorrent, proclaimed as the new “mainstream” of society.</p>

      <p>But far from being a crazed and random onslaught, this pattern is fully premeditated and purposefully implemented with leftist politicians, academia, “news” media outlets, and entertainment industry icons playing their scripted roles like the foot-soldiers of an advancing army. To many on the right, the attack appears to be unstoppable. America has, at times, seemed destined to be dragged down into an abyss of moral, social, and economic collapse.</p>
  <p> Hypocrisy, duplicity and lies reflects a flaw that demands correction, yet to leftists they are an enabling advantage; tools by which they can always deal themselves a winning hand. Unfortunately, far too many on the right are unwilling to call out liberal hypocrisy, duplicity and lies. Many prominent individuals, such as Republican politicians presumably on the “right,” completely fail to rise to the occasion and needlessly cede ground to the liberal agenda, when prevailing over the political left in such circumstances is contingent on a deliberate course of action. If not backed by decisive action to deal with their fraud, inactivity by Conservatives only serves to embolden them. Until this disparity between the two camps is recognized by those on the right, and thereafter properly rebutted in every circumstance, it will remain a political weapon giving the left an underserved and decisive edge.</p></>
