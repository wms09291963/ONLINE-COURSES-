      <p>Leftists often successfully ply their case through wholly fabricated precepts for the purpose of swaying popular opinion through manipulation. The end goal is to dominate the supposed “moral high ground” and position themselves to be perceived as the indisputable “objective” arbiters of virtue. Two of the Left’s most widely used and easily identifiable techniques of manipulation are labels and mantras. They will use labels to construct an impenetrable foundation of “right and wrong” that portrays their position as one of unassailable goodness, while thoroughly vilifying even the slightest opposition to it. The mantle of faux “virtue” is bestowed upon their opinion and its advocates, while condemning the conservative position as implicitly “evil.” They will then attempt to hard set these beliefs in the minds of the public through repetition.</p> 

      <p>While hatred, for example, would involve malicious actions that inflict harm on victims and damage to their property, the accusation of “hate speech” need not be accompanied by any supporting evidence, other than that somebody claims to have been emotionally harmed by it. Thus, it is no exaggeration that in the minds of Leftists, the truth itself is the ultimate “hate speech,” and to disagree with them on any given topic is “hateful.” In a similar manner, the rebranding of opposition to abortion is irrefutable evidence of “hatred towards women,” Christian organizations that uphold traditional values are “hate groups,” and Conservatives that advocate for freedom, our Constitution and Bill of Rights are deemed to be “racist, bigoted, White Supremacist Nazis.” The list of examples of labels </p></>
