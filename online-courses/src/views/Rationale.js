       <><h1 class="heading">Rationale for an Action Plan</h1>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, up until now, little concerted effort has ever been made to adequately counter the Leftists’ strategies once they became the core of Democrat Party politicking. And as a result, the concept of sincerely and legitimately debating any issue has been thoroughly supplanted by a preemptive barrage of fierce attacks against anyone daring to oppose their position. Though Conservatives should be accustomed to this sordid game plan by now, they are repeatedly blindsided by it. Rather than being able to weigh the pros and cons of a particular agenda item in the public arena, which would shift the argument unquestionably in their favor, Conservatives find themselves the targets of vile and baseless slander, to which they invariably react defensively and are rendered politically impotent in the debate.</p><p>While the forces of societal decay have been a plague on the human condition throughout all of history, certain modern proponents of disorder and dystopia stand out as key figures in the movement, possessing a degree of evil “genius” that sets them apart from typical revolutionaries and anarchists. Certainly, in the modern era, Karl Marx occupies the preeminent position among such subversives. But close in the shadow, and much more recently, the leftist ideology of Saul Alinksy and his pivotal work Rules for Radicals has done more to destructively transform American than any rampaging foreign army could ever have hoped to accomplish.</p><p>Based on Saul Alinsky’s strategies and those of his acolytes, Leftists have continued to devise and develop devious tactics beyond our imagination. They are conducting a revolution in America without ever firing a shot, an infiltration from within that as it transforms our nation, has left Americans confounded and confused. It is a new type of combat using psychological warfare. We are under assault as Americans constantly on the defensive, but now is the time we arise and take the offensive position.</p>
           <p>It is imperative that counterstrategies be developed to help Conservatives take the offensive position against the leftist assault.</p>
           <p>The purpose of this course is to equip Patriots to:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Memorize the Rules for Defeating Radicals,</li>
          <li>Learn to identify the Alinsky strategies,</li>
          <li>Explore the patterns and motivations behind the tactics,</li>
          <li>And empower Conservatives with principled counterstrategies.</li>

      </ol>
      <p>The purpose of this course is to properly equip and empower those Americans, who recognize the disastrous threat of the Left’s end game to destroy our nation and our way of life, an effort to identify the Alinsky strategies in their “strengths”, but more importantly the limits on what can be accomplished through them. The goal is not merely to provide an exposition of sordid leftist tactics, which would limit Conservatives to a strictly defensive posture, but rather to counter the entire collection of underhanded tactics being used by them. Furthermore, the goal is to properly equip and empower those Americans who recognize the disastrous threat of the Left’s end game to destroy our nation and our way of life. The focus is on identifying the pattern of Alinsky attacks, so that Conservatives can recognize their presence, gain an understanding of the nature, and by doing so, more quickly and effectively establish counter strategies using a ethical approach.</p></>
