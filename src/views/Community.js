      <p>Alinsky and his staff spread throughout the country, developing training institutes for community organizers, helping to form coalitions of anarchists, leftists, liberals, Democrats, black racialists, and Social Justice Activists. He is said to have inspired other sociologists and political activists to devise ways of conducting a revolution without ever firing a shot. Richard Cloward and Frances Piven, for example, conceived a plan to destroy local and state governments by overwhelming the welfare system with the poor. Amongst Alinsky’s trainees was Barack Obama who later became an attorney for another Alinsky organization, The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ACORN. Hillary Rodman was also an acolyte of Alinsky, writing her 1969 undergraduate senior thesis on Alinsky’s theories, which resulted in a personal interview Agenda: Grinding America Down. Bower, Curtis. Black Hat Films, 2010. Film.. She singled out the most important contribution to the radical cause as being his “embrace of political nihilism” Horowitz</p> 

      <p>First published in 1971, Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals, which was initially entitled Rules for Revolution, has been adopted as the main battle plan of the leftist counterculture. Without a doubt, the Alinksy strategy has succeeded far beyond the wildest dreams of its original enthusiasts. The scars borne across present day America, from its nightmarish inner cities, to its disastrously failing government schools, to its struggling and broken families, grimly attest to no less.</p></>
