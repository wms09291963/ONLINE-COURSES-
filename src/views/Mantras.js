      <p>These labels are solidified in the minds of the populace through mantras, words and phrases repeated as if through meditation or incantation. The echoed mantras are established as if they are the only accepted lexicon by leftist liberal politicians, their media minions, Hollywood “idols,” and the like, and then imposed upon Americans taking a stance against the Leftists’ positions. This seems to be a tactic borrowed from chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, Joseph Goebbels who famously said, “if you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.” </p> 

      <p>For a more complete list of labels and how mantras are employed, it is suggested that the reader refer to Christopher G. Adamos text, Rules for Defeating Radicals. The list of examples of labels and how they are indoctrinated into the psyche of the American people is endless. The transformative nature of the labels and mantras has been so successful, under such circumstances, the eventual demise of our Constitution, and the great nation it birthed, seems to be all but inevitable. All hope, however, is not lost.</p></>
