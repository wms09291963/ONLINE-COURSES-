# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

I've attached the rough draft of the course I was telling you about. I don't expect you to read everything and respond immediately, just at your leisure. This is only the first draft. I expect to finish everything by Friday next week, then send it to Christopher G. Adamo for him to review, make changes, etc.

Chris is the author of Rules for Defeating Radicals. In his book he studied Marxist revolutionary Saul Alinksy's Rules for Radicals published in 1971. People like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were his followers, and other Marxist Communists too Alinsky's methods, expounded upon them and are using them even today. So Chris Adamo came up with his own Rules for Defeating Radicals as counterstrategies.

We want to make parts of his book into a short course, so people can go online, quickly learn Chris' strategies and use them. Just like I first contacted Adamo and asked him if I could turn his book into a course, I want to do the same with other authors if I think their work is conducive to a course. I want short courses for working and busy people who may not have time to read a whole book, but want to quickly learn some skills that they can use.

The goal is also to empower and encourage people to be active and positive, be bold and speak the truth.

Actually, Mike, my goal is to make a website full of courses, resources, reference material, glossary of terms and information for people to use, and call the website "The Patriot's Portal".

So please skim through and let me know what you think. I already have in mind how I want it laid out. Very simple to maneuver, nothing too complicated.
